    # 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

    **Medium** · Dynamic Programming, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph Theory, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

    There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

    You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return **the cheapest price** from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return `-1`.

    ## Examples

    ![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-3drawio.png)

    ```
    Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
    Output: 700
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
    Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
    ```

    ![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-1drawio.png)

    ```
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
    Output: 200
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
    ```

    ![Example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-2drawio.png)

    ```
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
    Output: 500
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - 2 <= n <= 100
    - 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
    - flights[i].length == 3
    - 0 <= fromi, toi < n
    - fromi != toi
    - 1 <= pricei <= 10^4
    - There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
    - 0 <= src, dst, k < n
    - src != dst

    # 12. Integer to Roman

    **Medium** · Hash Table, Math, String

    Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

    | Symbol | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | I | 1 |
    | V | 5 |
    | X | 10 |
    | L | 50 |
    | C | 100 |
    | D | 500 |
    | M | 1000 |

    Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

    - If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
    - If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the **subtractive form** representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (`I`) less than 5 (`V`): `IV` and 9 is 1 (`I`) less than 10 (`X`): `IX`. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (`IV`), 9 (`IX`), 40 (`XL`), 90 (`XC`), 400 (`CD`) and 900 (`CM`).
    - Only powers of 10 (`I`, `X`, `C`, `M`) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (`V`), 50 (`L`), or 500 (`D`) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the **subtractive form**.

    Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: num = 3749
    Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

    Explanation:

    3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
     700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
      40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
       9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
    Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
    ```

    ```
    Input: num = 58
    Output: "LVIII"

    Explanation:

    50 = L
     8 = VIII
    ```

    ```
    Input: num = 1994
    Output: "MCMXCIV"

    Explanation:

    1000 = M
     900 = CM
      90 = XC
       4 = IV
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - `1 <= num <= 3999`

    # 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

    **Easy** · Array, Dynamic Programming

    You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

    Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    ```
    **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

    ```
    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    ```
    **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
    - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

    Implement the unfinished methods below, then press **Run tests**.

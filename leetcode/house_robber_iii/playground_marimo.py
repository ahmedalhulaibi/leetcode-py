    # 337. House Robber III

    **Medium** · Dynamic Programming, Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree

    The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

    Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

    Given the `root` of the binary tree, return *the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police***.

    ## Examples

    ![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
    ```

    ![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
    Output: 9
    Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
    - 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4

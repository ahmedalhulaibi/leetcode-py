    # 2182. Construct String With Repeat Limit

    **Medium** · Hash Table, String, Greedy, Heap (Priority Queue), Counting

    You are given a string `s` and an integer `repeatLimit`. Construct a new string `repeatLimitedString` using the characters of `s` such that no letter appears **more than** `repeatLimit` times **in a row**. You do **not** have to use all characters from `s`.

    Return *the **lexicographically largest*** `repeatLimitedString` *possible*.

    A string `a` is **lexicographically larger** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: s = "cczazcc", repeatLimit = 3
    Output: "zzcccac"
    Explanation: We use all of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "zzcccac".
    The letter 'a' appears at most 1 time in a row.
    The letter 'c' appears at most 3 times in a row.
    The letter 'z' appears at most 2 times in a row.
    Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
    The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "zzcccac".
    Note that the string "zzcccca" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'c' appears more than 3 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
    ```

    ```
    Input: s = "aababab", repeatLimit = 2
    Output: "bbabaa"
    Explanation: We use only some of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "bbabaa".
    The letter 'a' appears at most 2 times in a row.
    The letter 'b' appears at most 2 times in a row.
    Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
    The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "bbabaa".
    Note that the string "bbabaaa" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'a' appears more than 2 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - `1 <= repeatLimit <= s.length <= 10^5`
    - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

    # 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

    **Medium** · Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy

    You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

    On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the **same day**, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.

    Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 7
    ```
    **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
    Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

    ```
    Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    ```
    **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Total profit is 4.

    ```
    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    ```
    **Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4
    - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

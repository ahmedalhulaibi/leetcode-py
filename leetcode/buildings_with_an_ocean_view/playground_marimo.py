    # 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View

    **Medium** · Array, Stack, Monotonic Stack

    <p>There are <code>n</code> buildings in a line. You are given an integer array <code>heights</code> of size <code>n</code> that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.</p>

    <p>The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a <strong>smaller</strong> height.</p>

    <p>Return a list of indices <strong>(0-indexed)</strong> of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.</p>

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
    Output: [0,2,3]
    ```
    **Explanation:** Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

    ```
    Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
    Output: [0,1,2,3]
    ```
    **Explanation:** All the buildings have an ocean view.

    ```
    Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
    Output: [3]
    ```
    **Explanation:** Only building 3 has an ocean view.

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
    - 1 <= heights[i] <= 10^9

    Implement the unfinished methods below, then press **Run tests**.

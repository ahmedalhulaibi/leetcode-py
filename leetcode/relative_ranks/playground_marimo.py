    # 506. Relative Ranks

    **Easy** · Array, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)

    You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `i^th` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

    The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1^st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2^nd` place athlete has the `2^nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

    - The `1^st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
    - The `2^nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
    - The `3^rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
    - For the `4^th` place to the `n^th` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `x^th` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

    Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the `i^th` athlete.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
    Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
    Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
    ```

    ```
    Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
    Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
    Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - `n == score.length`
    - `1 <= n <= 10^4`
    - `0 <= score[i] <= 10^6`
    - All the values in `score` are **unique**.

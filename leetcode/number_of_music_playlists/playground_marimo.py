    # 920. Number of Music Playlists

    **Hard** · Math, Dynamic Programming, Combinatorics

    Your music player contains <code>n</code> different songs. You want to listen to <code>goal</code> songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

    <ul>
        <li>Every song is played <strong>at least once</strong>.</li>
        <li>A song can only be played again only if <code>k</code> other songs have been played.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given <code>n</code>, <code>goal</code>, and <code>k</code>, return <em>the number of possible playlists that you can create</em>. Since the answer can be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
    ```

    ```
    Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
    ```

    ```
    Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - 0 &lt;= k &lt; n &lt;= goal &lt;= 100

    # 860. Lemonade Change

    **Easy** · Array, Greedy

    At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by `bills`). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `$5`.

    Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

    Given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the `ith` customer pays, return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
    Output: true
    Explanation:
    From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
    From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
    From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
    Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
    ```

    ```
    Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
    Output: false
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= bills.length <= 10^5
    - `bills[i]` is either `5`, `10`, or `20`.

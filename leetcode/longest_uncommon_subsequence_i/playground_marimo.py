    # 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

    **Easy** · String

    Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between `a` and `b`. If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return `-1`.

    An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of exactly one of them.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
    Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
    ```

    ```
    Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".
    ```

    ```
    Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
    Output: -1
    Explanation: Every subsequence of string `a` is also a subsequence of string `b`.
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100
    - `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

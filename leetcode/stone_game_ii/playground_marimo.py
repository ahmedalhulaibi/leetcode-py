    # 1140. Stone Game II

    **Medium** · Array, Math, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum, Game Theory

    Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

    Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.

    On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`. Initially, M = 1.

    The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

    Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
    Output: 10
    Explanation:
    If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 stones in total.
    If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 stones in total.
    So we return 10 since it's larger.
    ```

    ```
    Input: piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]
    Output: 104
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
    - `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4`

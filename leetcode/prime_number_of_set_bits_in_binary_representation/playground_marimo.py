    # 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

    **Easy** · Math, Bit Manipulation, Primality Test

    Given two integers `left` and `right`, return *the **count** of numbers in the **inclusive** range* `[left, right]` *having a **prime number of set bits** in their binary representation*.

    Recall that the **number of set bits** an integer has is the number of `1`'s present when written in binary.

    - For example, `21` written in binary is `10101`, which has `3` set bits.

    ## Examples

    ```
    Input: left = 6, right = 10
    Output: 4
    Explanation:
    6  -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    7  -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
    9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
    ```

    ```
    Input: left = 10, right = 15
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
    13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
    15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
    5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
    ```

    ## Constraints

    - 1 <= left <= right <= 10<sup>6</sup>
    - 0 <= right - left <= 10<sup>4</sup>
